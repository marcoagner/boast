# This Let's Encrypt pre-validation hook is to be used for the DNS-01 challenge with
# BOAST's main domain. It's made to work with the Dockerfile in this directory and may
# need some changes for customized use cases.
#
# This hook will only be run if the certificate is due for renewal, so certbot can be
# run frequently (e.g. as a cron job) without unnecessarily stopping BOAST.
#
# Doc on how to use this with the provided Dockerfile (and more):
# https://github.com/marcoagner/boast/blob/master/docs/deploying.md#deploying-with-docker
